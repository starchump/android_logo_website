This is starchump's first "real" HTML/CSS project.
I say "real" because I really just copied the code from an online tutorial.
A couple a changes I made from the tutorial (to the best of my ability):
    - unspecified background -> grey background
    - positioned the grandparent "android" as absolute and centered
        in the viewport, so it stays centered on window resize
Not sure if I changed anything else really, but I learned a bit about
positioning elements. Took a good bit of reading and trial/error.
